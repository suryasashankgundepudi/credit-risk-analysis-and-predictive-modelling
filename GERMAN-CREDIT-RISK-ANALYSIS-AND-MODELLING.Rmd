## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Testing plotly

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(tidyr)
library(descr)

data <- read.csv("data/eda-german-credit.csv")
fig1 <- plot_ly(
  data = data, 
  x = c("Good", "Bad"), 
  y = c(length(data$Outcome[data$Outcome == "Good"]), 
        length(data$Outcome[data$Outcome == "Bad"])),  
  type = "bar", 
  marker = list(color = c("Green", "Red"))
)

fig1 <- fig1 %>%   layout(
  title = 'Target Variable Distribution', 
  xaxis = list(title = 'Outcome of Risk Taken'), 
  font=t, 
  plot_bgcolor = "#e5ecf6",
  yaxis = list(title = 'Count'), 
  legend = list(title=list(text='Legend Title')))

```

Now including the plot
```{r}
# Un-comment this line to get the figure
fig1
```
