# german-credit-risk-modelling

*This is an Ongoing Project*
Within this project I explore the Statlog German Credit Risk data from the UCI machine learning repository. I aim to explore the data using interactive and detailed visualizations and derive inferences from the same. Following this I wish to train the and cross validate various machine learning algorithms to find the optimal ML Algorithm to deploy on a Shiny Web Application.
